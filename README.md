# CovidStat-backend

The goal of this project is to be a kickstart to your .Net WebApi, implementing the most common used patterns
and technologies for a restful API in .net, making your work easier.

# How to run
- clone/download to your local workplace.
- Download the latest .Net SDK and Visual Studio/Code.

## Standalone
1. You have to change your connection string to "Server=127.0.0.1;Database=CovidStat;User=sa;Password=Yourpassword123‚Äù and run api and webapp projects:
	- If you want, you can change the DatabaseExtension to use UseInMemoryDatabase, instead of Mssql.
2. Go to the src/CovidStat.Api folder and run ``dotnet run``, or, in visual studio set the api project as startup and run as console or docker (not IIS).
3. Visit http://localhost:5000/api-docs or https://localhost:5001/api-docs to access the application's swagger.

## Authentication
In this project, some routes requires authentication/authorization. For that, you will have to use the ``api/user/authenticate`` route to obtain the JWT.
As default, you have two users, Admin and normal user.
- Normal user: 
	- email: user@boilerplate.com
	- password: userpassword
- Admin:
	- email: admin@boilerplate.com
	- password: adminpassword

After that, you can pass the jwt on the lock (if using swagger) or via the Authorization header on a http request.
